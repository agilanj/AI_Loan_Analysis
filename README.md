# AI LOAN ANALYSIS APPLICATIION
## Secure ai driven loan analysis management application


## Project Objective:
 The objective of this project is to develop a secure, efficient, and intelligent loan
evaluation system using Zoho Creator that integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI) for credit
analysis. The system aims to protect sensitive applicant data through masking techniques
while utilizing ChatGPT to evaluate loan eligibility based on the applicant's input. This
project combines low-code application development, AI integration, and cybersecurity
principles to enhance the decision-making process for loan approvals.

## Project Description:
This project focuses on building a secure and intelligent loan application
management platform using Zoho Creator, a low-code development environment. The core
innovation lies in the integration of ChatGPT, an AI-powered language model, to assist in
evaluating the creditworthiness of loan applicants. To maintain data privacy and security,
sensitive applicant data—such as names, contact details, PAN numbers, and income
figures—is masked before being sent to the AI for analysis. The AI processes this masked
data and returns an eligibility result in a similarly anonymized format. The system then
maps the AI-generated result back to the actual applicant record securely, enabling
administrators to make informed decisions without exposing private data during processing.

The application includes features such as applicant data entry forms, credit score
validation, document verification status, and an admin dashboard for decision-making.
Deluge scripting is used to implement logic such as, automated workflows, and secure data
handling. By combining AI-driven analysis with strong cybersecurity practices, this project
ensures both intelligent processing and protection of user information.

On the above image a loan evaluation prompt was provided to the ChatGPT API
using customer details. The AI analyzed the data and generated a clear eligibility decision
along with reasoning in the evaluation comments.

After the ChatGPT analysis, the admin reviews the evaluation, sets the
recommended loan amount, selects the appropriate application status, and submits the final
decision

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the integration of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity
within a low-code business application environment using Zoho Creator. By leveraging the
capabilities of the ChatGPT API, the system effectively analyzes customer data and
generates accurate loan evaluations. The incorporation of data masking ensures the
protection of personally identifiable information during the evaluation process, maintaining
both compliance and trust. Through structured form design, automated workflows, and
intelligent decision-making, this solution simplifies the loan assessment process for
administrators. Overall, this project highlights the potential of combining AI and secure
development practices to build smarter, safer, and more efficient business applications.
